# Bukkit-RTP

This plugin enables players to teleport to a random location in the wilderness. Handy for stopping griefers!

### Installing the Easy Way

1. Download the `.jar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/David-Hickey/Bukkit-RTP/releases/latest).
1. Put the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` directory.


### Building from Source (Advanced users only)

This plugin builds with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - if you don't have that, you'll need to install it before continuing. To install, open a terminal or command prompt and do the following:
1. Navigate to the folder containing `pom.xml` and then run `mvn clean install`.
1. A directory called `target` will appear in the same directory. Inside that directory will be a file called something like `bukkit_rtp-1.0.0.jar` - the number at the end might be different.
1. Copy `bukkit_rtp-1.0.0.jar` into your server's `plugins` directory.
